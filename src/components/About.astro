       I'm Jes√∫s Alberola Herrero, a passionate musician and programmer from Spain. From a young age, my two great loves have been <strong class="italic">music and technology.</strong>
      </p>
  
      <p>
        In 2019, after a decade of intensive studies at the Villena Professional Conservatory of Music, I graduated as a <strong class="italic">piano teacher and music composer.</strong> That was when I decided to embark on a new adventure and moved to picturesque Norway. Currently, I have the honor of being a piano teacher at Sandnes Kulturskole, where I enjoy sharing my love for music with young talents.

            ... there was always an additional spark in my life: <strong class="italic">programming.</strong> Since childhood, I have been fascinated by video games and computers, and that interest never disappeared. So, in 2023, I decided to make an exciting career shift and started studying <strong class="italic"> front-end development</strong> to fulfill that latent passion.
          </p>
    
          <p>
            Now, I feel fortunate to combine my two great passions: music and programming. Every day, I find new ways to integrate musical creativity with the logic and design of web development.
